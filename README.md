# cuba-geojsons
Cuba related geojsons

Project for Cuba related geojson files.

Now it has geojson files with cuban provinces and municipalities boundaries.  

For each case there is one file with the region boundaries (municipalieties or provinces) for the whole Cuba and others with the boundaries for each province.

# to be fixed

There are some problems with municipalities boundaries that will corrected in the future. The municipalities with the biggest problems are Esmeralda and Nuevitas, in Camaguey. Esmeralda has a part of its territory (a key) that belongs to Nuevitas. This will be the first thing to be corrected.
